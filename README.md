### Key Features:

1. **Geolocation-Based Check-In/Check-Out:**
    - **Automatic Check-In:** When an employee enters within a 200-meter radius of the office, the app will automatically record their check-in time and location.
    - **Automatic Check-Out:** When the employee leaves the 200-meter radius, the app will automatically record their check-out time.
    - **Pairing of Check-Ins and Check-Outs:** Each check-in must be paired with a corresponding check-out, regardless of how many times the employee enters and exits the premises.
2. **Manual Location Check-In/Check-Out for Offsite Work:**
    - **Manual Feature:** Allows employees to manually check in and out when working offsite.
    - **Location Suggestions:** The app will suggest relevant locations based on real-time longitude and latitude data, allowing employees to confirm their check-in and check-out at these suggested locations.
3. **Work Hours Calculation:**
    - The app will calculate the total working hours for each employee based on their check-in and check-out records.
4. **Data Accuracy and Integrity:**
    - **Real-Time Synchronization:** The app should synchronize data in real-time to ensure that records are accurate and tamper-proof.
    - **Secure Storage:** The app must securely store attendance data to prevent data loss and ensure reliability.

### My Flow for the project

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **User Authentication:**
    - Implement user registration and login using Firebase Authentication.
    - Store user information like name, role, and office location in the database.
2. **Geolocation and Geofencing:**
    - Implement check-in/check-out logic using the `geolocator` package.
    - Set up geofences with a 200-meter radius around each office location.
    - When a user enters the geofence, automatically record a check-in with time and location.
    - Similarly, record a check-out when exiting the geofence.
    - Consider using a background service with the `workmanager` package to ensure location updates even when the app is not in the foreground.
3. **Manual Check-In/Check-Out:**
    - Develop a dedicated screen for manual check-in/check-out for offsite work.
    - Use the user's current location (latitude/longitude) to suggest nearby office locations based on a pre-defined list.
    - Allow users to confirm manual check-in/check-out at suggested locations.
4. **Calculating Work Hours:**
    - Store check-in and check-out timestamps in the database.
    - Develop logic to calculate the total working hours based on the recorded timestamps.
5. **Data Accuracy and Integrity:**
    - Implement robust error handling for location services and data storage.
    - Use secure data storage in Firebase with proper authentication rules.
    - Consider real-time data synchronization with the server to ensure data availability even if the app is offline.
